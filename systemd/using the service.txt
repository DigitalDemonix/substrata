The service should be installed into /etc/systemd/user/ (on development)
and in /etc/systemd/system (in production)

Reload after adding the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

(if you installed it as a user service in development, drop sudo and
append --user to the following commands)

Now enable and start the service:
sudo systemctl enable cyberspace-server.service
sudo systemctl start cyberspace-server.service

you can see the status with (doesnt need sudo)
systemctl status cyberspace-server.service

and the log with
sudo journalctl --unit=cyberspace-server.service
